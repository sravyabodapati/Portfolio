<h5>I'm Sravya Bodapati.</h5> <p>I am a student at Dublin High School and will be graduating in June of 2020. I currently live in California as I have my entire life. I have a little knowledge of a few code languages and hope to extend my knowledge in the future. I am taking a Computer Science Principles class this year through which I hope to learn more about various different programming languages. I have been practicing martial arts for eight years and got my black belt in Kuk Sool Won martial arts as well as many awards. Other than these basic facts about me,I consider myself to be a strong team player and I have a passion to learn. I pride myself in being focused, efficient, persistent, and being able to easily build rapport.
</p>
<p>
After graduating from Dublin High School in 2020, I will be attending UC Riverside, where I will major in Computer Science with Business Applications. After getting my Bachelor’s degree, I plan to continue my studies to get my Master’s degree in Computer Science. I hope to become a web developer, ideally in a company as acclaimed as Google. I strive to learn more about coding everyday. As of now, I know the basics of Python, HTML, Scratch, and CSS. I have made two games in the past and have also created my own website. I am also recognized as a Microsoft Technology Associate for Introduction to Programming using HTML and CSS. Other than coding, I love photography, cooking, and playing the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
I had a summer job at a childcare center called Safari Kid a few years ago, which was my first job and work experience. I loved working with the kids there and I met many new people. I also lead classes at my martial arts school, so I pride myself in being able to work well with both kids and adults. My experience also includes working at a tutoring center called Eyelevel, which was a new experience for me and was a valuable experience.
</p>
<p>This is just a little about who I am. Thanks for taking the time to read through this to get to know me. I hope you'll explore the rest of this website to learn a little more about my experiences. If you have any questions or comments, visit the Contact Me page to find out how to reach me.
